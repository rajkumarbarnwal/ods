Binary Tree:
A tree is said to be binary tree if each node have either 0,1 or 2 child nodes.

Or

A tree is said to be binary tree if each node 
have no child node or maximum two child nodes.

Types of Binary tree
--------------------
1. Strictly Binary tree
2. Complete Binary tree
3. Almost complete Binary tree
4. Binary search Tree

Strictly Binary tree(SBT)
--------------------
A tree is said to be SBT 
if each node have either no child node or two child nodes.
OR
A binary tree is said to be SBT
if each internal node have two child nodes.

Complete Binary Tree(CBT)
-------------------------
A tree is said to be complete binary tree
if satisfies the following two points.
-Each internal node must have two child nodes and
-All leaf nodes are present at the same level.

Almost Complete Binary Tree (ACBT)
-----------------------------------
A tree is said to be ACBT 
if it satisfies the following two points.
-upto n-2 level, each internal node must have two child nodes.
-And the last level is going to fill from left to right.

Binary Search Tree(BST)
-----------------------
A tree is said to be binary search tree(BST)
if it satifies the following point.
-each parent node is greater than from it left child and less then from its right child.
